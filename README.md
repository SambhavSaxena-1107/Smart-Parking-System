# Smart-Parking-System
IoT based Smart Car Parking Management System helps in efficient parking space utilization.
This smart parking system consists of Arduino UNO, six IR sensors, one servo motor, and one LCD display.
The Arduino UNO is the main microcontroller that controls the whole system.
Two IR sensors are used at the entry and exit gates to detect vehicle entry and exit in the parking area. 
Other four IR sensors are used to detect the parking slot availability. 
The servo motor is placed at the entry and exit gate that is used to open and close the gates.
Also, an LCD display is placed at the entrance, which is used to show the availability of parking slots in the parking area.
